### About Book ###
In this digital era of rapidly evolving web technologies, Programming with Deno 2 invites you to explore the next generation of JavaScript and TypeScript runtime. Blending the power of TypeScript’s static type system with Deno’s revolutionary security and tooling, this book takes you from installation to advanced real-world applications.

You’ll learn core Deno concepts—installation, REPL, permissions, and asynchronous programming—then dive into practical projects: building HTTP servers, interacting with various databases, integrating React and Material UI, deploying Fresh applications, leveraging WebSockets, and even combining AI or IoT with Deno. Each chapter is enriched with code samples, best practices, and step-by-step walkthroughs so you can put theory into practice from day one.
